# ðŸ§¹ LogCleaner

LogCleaner is a lightweight and efficient plugin that automatically cleans up your server's logs/ and crash-reports/ folders â€” so you don't have to!

I originally made it because I was tired of my WinSCP almost crashing every time I opened the logs folder â€” now it's public, and maybe it can help you too.

# ðŸ”§ Features

Automatically delete old log files
Supports two cleaning modes:
By days: delete logs older than a defined number of days
By amount: keep only the most recent X log files
Optional cleanup of crash reports
Fully configurable via config.yml
Java 8 compatible â€” works on all Minecraft versions from 1.7+

# ðŸ“‚ Example use cases

Keep your server clean and tidy
Prevent lag when opening folders via FTP clients like WinSCP
Automate annoying manual cleanup work
